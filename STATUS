RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * Drop modules.c code and replace much functionality with the
      apr dso methods, etc.

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * APR-util ./testall demonstrates that on finalization (when the
      users calls with NULL inbuf and their target outbuf) that the
      utf-7 converter doesn't exit the shift-state.  Not certain that
      this is in fact a bug in the code, an unimplemented feature or
      a mistaken assumption in the apr-util/test/testxlate.c code.

Other features that need writing:


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
